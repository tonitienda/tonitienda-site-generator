# Function call cascading considered harmful

## Introduction

Improving the reusability and composability of software components is a common goal we all strive for. However, more often than not, we find ourselves falling short without a clear understanding of why. Sometimes, we favor one approach over another without a solid rationale, labeling the differences as mere programming styles.

In my case, I have a preference for writing code that reads like recipes. I strive to develop functions or components as if they will be utilized by multiple clients, even if that's not the current scenario. This personal style offers benefits such as reusability and testability, but I have also realized that it tends to veer toward overengineering, so it's important to keep that in check.

During a recent refactoring process, I encountered a situation where the code followed a different style, and I found it more challenging to reason about, test, and reuse. Yet, I couldn't pinpoint a specific term or a clear, general rationale to explain why I felt that way.

Upon reflection, I discovered the root of the problem, and with the help of Chat GPT, I uncovered the terms associated with those distinct styles.

To illustrate the problem clearly and make it more apparent, I will provide an example.

## The problem

Consider a web application that processes user registrations. When a new user signs up, various tasks need to be performed, such as validating the user's data, creating a user account, sending a confirmation email, and logging the registration event.

### Function call cascading

One way of implementing this functionality is using function call cascading:

```mermaid

  sequenceDiagram

  actor Client
  participant registerUser
  participant validateUser
  participant createUser
  participant sendConfirmationEmail
  participant logRegistration

  registerUser ->> validateUser: userData
  validateUser ->> createUser: userData
  createUser ->> sendConfirmationEmail: userData
  sendConfirmationEmail ->> logRegistration: userData
```

```javascript
function registerUser(userData) {
  validateUser(userData);
}

function validateUser(userData) {
  if (userData.username && userData.email && userData.password) {
    createUser(userData);
  } else {
    console.log("Invalid user data.");
  }
}

function createUser(userData) {
  // Logic to create a user account

  sendConfirmationEmail(userData);
}

function sendConfirmationEmail(userData) {
  // Logic to send a confirmation email

  logRegistration(userData);
}

function logRegistration(userData) {
  // Logic to log the registration event

  console.log("User registration completed.");
}
```

Although this simplified code example might seem obvious, we often use this pattern and make functions call the next function in the sequence.

### Recipe - Composition

Another way is to use a recipe-like expression:

```mermaid

  sequenceDiagram

  actor Client
  participant registerUser
  participant validateUser
  participant createUser
  participant sendConfirmationEmail
  participant logRegistration

  registerUser ->> validateUser: userData
  registerUser ->> createUser: userData
  registerUser ->> sendConfirmationEmail: userData
  registerUser ->> logRegistration: userData
```

```javascript
function registerUser(userData) {
  if (validateUser(userData)) {
    createUser(userData);
    sendConfirmationEmail(userData);
    logRegistration(userData);
    console.log("User registration completed.");
  } else {
    console.log("Invalid user data.");
  }
}

function validateUser(userData) {
  return userData.username && userData.email && userData.password;
}

function createUser(userData) {
  // Logic to create a user account
}

function sendConfirmationEmail(userData) {
  // Logic to send a confirmation email
}

function logRegistration(userData) {
  // Logic to log the registration event
}
```

## Analysis

### Objective coupling

When employing function call cascading, all functions become tightly coupled to the objectives of the functions they call down the line.

For instance, let's consider the `registerUser` function with the following goals:

- Validate user
- Create user
- Send confirmation email
- Log registration

In this case, the `validateUser` function will **inherit** the same goals as `registerUser`. Similarly, the `createUser` function will inherit all goals except for the validation of the user, and so on.

```mermaid

subgraph Functions
  registerUser
  validateUser
  createUser
  sendConfirmationEmail
  logRegistration
end

subgraph Goals
  validate-user[validate user]
  create-user[create user]
  send-confirmation-email[send confirmation email]
  log-registration[log registration]
end

registerUser --> validateUser
registerUser -.- validate-user
registerUser -.- create-user
registerUser -.- send-confirmation-email
registerUser -.- log-registration


validateUser --> createUser
validateUser -.->validate-user
validateUser -.- create-user
validateUser -.- send-confirmation-email
validateUser -.- log-registration


createUser --> sendConfirmationEmail
createUser -.->create-user
createUser -.- send-confirmation-email
createUser -.- log-registration


sendConfirmationEmail --> logRegistration
sendConfirmationEmail -.->send-confirmation-email
sendConfirmationEmail -.- log-registration


logRegistration -.->log-registration
```

```mermaid

flowchart LR

subgraph Functions
  registerUser
  validateUser
  createUser
  sendConfirmationEmail
  logRegistration
end

subgraph Goals
  validate-user[validate user]
  create-user[create user]
  send-confirmation-email[send confirmation email]
  log-registration[log registration]
end

registerUser --> validateUser
registerUser --> createUser
registerUser --> sendConfirmationEmail
registerUser --> logRegistration

registerUser -.- validate-user
registerUser -.- create-user
registerUser -.- send-confirmation-email
registerUser -.- log-registration


validateUser -.->validate-user

createUser -.->create-user

sendConfirmationEmail -.->send-confirmation-email

logRegistration -.->log-registration
```

This means that I cannot use any of the intermediate functions in a different context than the one aimed at achieving all those goals.

I intentionally use the term **inherit** because the problem is reminiscent of the issues that arise when using inheritance for code reusability.

### Single responsibility

In line with the issue of objective coupling, every function that calls another function becomes coupled with the responsibilities of the subsequent function. While this coupling may make sense in some cases, such as the `registerUser` function being responsible for all the effects (storing in a database, sending emails, etc.) related to user registration, even if it delegates each effect to a specific function.

On the other hand, the `validateUser` function should solely be responsible for user validation. However, by utilizing function call cascading, we inadvertently introduce the responsibility of creating a user, sending emails, and so on.

### Testing

When conducting integration testing on the `registerUser` function (or any other top-level entry point), it becomes necessary to mock the entire I/O environment to ensure

correct behavior. However, it would be preferable to conduct unit tests on the individual composed functions in isolation.

As a result of the objective and responsibility coupling, when function call cascading is used, we find ourselves obligated to mock the environment for testing each of the composed functions as well.

> It's worth noting that certain languages, like Python with pytest fixtures, provide mechanisms that facilitate the mocking of intermediate functions.

## Conclusion

To enhance code reusability, testability, readability, and more, it is crucial to be self-conscious when encountering deep function call cascades. Take a moment to consider whether the flow you're attempting to describe could be flattened and written as a recipe instead. I firmly believe that by keeping a vigilant eye on this aspect, we can improve both our code and our overall development experiences.
