# Loosely coupled components with EDA

  TODO: see if the title should be "Highly coupled components with EDA" since
  EDA might sound like a silver bullet to decouple components

## About coupling

Before understanding how to decouple components we need to understand what coupling is.
All engineers have an image about coupling but I will try to explain here my image so we can start from
the same stand point.

Maybe the discussion about coupling needs its own post or even a book, but here I will try to set a baseline
for the rest of this post.

This post is focused on coupling mainly in distributed systems. I could not find a list of types of coupling
for distribured systems, so I created my own.

Feel free to contact me if it makes no sense of there is a resource I can refer to.

### Types of coupling

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">See references</span>
There are several types of coupling:

#### Runtime coupling

A component needs to be implemented in the same language/technology as the other component.
Although it does not sound like related to distributed systems, there was a time when objects where
shared directly by distributed components (see CORBA).

#### Deployment coupling

A component needs to be deployed together with another component.

  A bit more detail: components released in Sidecar for example
</span>

#### Temporal coupling

A component needs another component to be "alive" at least during an operation.
For example, any component that invokes another component and needs a response back in order
to continue the operation.

This can happen when using HTTP APIs but also using message brokers. As soon as the caller needs to required a response
there is some temporal coupling.

#### Data format / Schema coupling

A component needs to know the data schema of another component to perform its operations.
This one is almost unavoidable. If a component needs to communicate to another it will need to know what
is the expected format of the data to be sent or the data being received.

For example a component invokes another via http request or a component subscribed to events from another.

#### Semantic coupling

A component needs to understand the semantics of the data of another component in order to perform an operation.
For example when a component invokes another to perform an operation, apart from the schema, it needs to understand
what the operation means.
When a component subscribes to an event it needs to understand what the event means. Not only what the payload contains.
